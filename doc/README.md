# termwriter-py Documentation

## Overview

`termwriter-py` is a library to organize the output to the terminal.

The basic concept of `termwriter-py` is to print text into "boxes" that can be
placed side-by-side to reclaim the unused spaces on the right side of the
terminal.  If too many boxes are placed next to each other, they "wrap" to the
following row, hopefully still within the terminal's viewport, but either way
viewable by scrolling vertically.
